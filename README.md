# MLOps_IISC_CCE

When it comes to managing the development process in the tech industry, the terminologies DevOps, MLOps, 
and ModelOps are widely used. If you are new to these terms or unsure of which one to choose, you are not alone. 
Depending on your company’s maturity level, you might have experienced challenges in aligning the development 
process with your business objectives and goals. Using one or all of these approaches can help you with a seamless development process.

DevOps, MLOps, and ModelOps are all methodologies for managing the development and deployment of machine learning models. In short terms:

DevOps (Development Operations): is a general methodology for managing the software development lifecycle, focused on integrating development
and operations teams to ensure a streamlined and continuous delivery process.

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations): refers to the set of practices for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring.

ModelOps (Model Operations): this is a newer approach that focuses specifically on the operationalization of machine learning models, with an emphasis on model monitoring, maintenance, and governance.
Utilizing one or more of these approaches for a project, depending on your unique case, is essential for ensuring that the model development and deployment process is efficient, effective, scalable, 
and sustainable. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice will depend on your project’s specific needs and goals.
